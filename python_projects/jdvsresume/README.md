Script to automate job search and create a csv of matching keywords

Current Issue: If logged in to linkedin to search for a job, linkedin will do a bot verification.
Proposed Solution: Go to google and search for the jobs in linkedin, look for this website 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/linkedin/jobs'. If directly going to this website then linkedin login is required. Can be bypassed by going through google search. Find text, 'LinkedIn: Jobs'
