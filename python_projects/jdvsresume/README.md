Script to automate job search and create a csv of matching keywords

Issue #2: Need to find a way to select each job listing from the class: jobs-search__results-list and copy the text of the job description

(Solved)
Issue #1: If logged in to linkedin to search for a job, linkedin will do a bot verification.
Proposed Solution: Go to google and search for the jobs in linkedin, look for this website 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/linkedin/jobs'. If directly going to this website then linkedin login is required. Can be bypassed by going through google search. Find text, 'LinkedIn: Jobs'
