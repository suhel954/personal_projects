Task #2: Click on each job listing and copy the text

Issue #4: Seems like logging in as an existing user in the beginning will make it a lot easier to navigate
Task #1: Add login in the beginning of the script
(Solved)
Issue #3: Job listing is available as a list but the list cannot be clicked with a link

(Solved)

Issue #1: If logged in to linkedin to search for a job, linkedin will do a bot verification.
Proposed Solution: Go to google and search for the jobs in linkedin, look for this website 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/linkedin/jobs'. If directly going to this website then linkedin login is required. Can be bypassed by going through google search. Find text, 'LinkedIn: Jobs'
